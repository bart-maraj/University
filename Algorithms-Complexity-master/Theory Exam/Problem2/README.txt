Three .java files are given.

CodeProblem2_powerof2.java : Length is a power of 2.
CodeProblem2_aux.java : The length doesn´t matter but only the final average is obtained.
CodeProblem2.java : Lenght doen´t matter and all the averages are calculated.

In "CodeProblem2.java" the final value is rounded because in eclipse, when doing divisions,
some decimals are lost, so the calculated average was missing some of these decimals.
